# Tech-Blog

## Description
This is a Tech Blog webpage that has multiple functionalities to it including,
a login/logout feature, a dashboard to view posts from others, the ability to post new blog posts, 
as well as comment and reaction functionality. Creating this application taught me how to make a functioning media page with a login and logout feature,
also creating databases models and routes, linking them to the front end using handlebars.  

## Usage
To use this program, login or create a new login. Then you will have access to the dashboard where you can see posts, create new posts, update posts, and delete posts.
